Philosophy of this Course

1. Care about the quality. We've designed and executed this course around the Golden Rule; we want to provide training that we wish could have existed when we were learning the technology.

2. People have different learning abilities and backgrounds. Many of you may even have English as a secondary professional language. So we do our best to present clearly, provide information in plain English, minimize jargon, plus use examples and visuals to help you learn.

3. Provide practical training that bring in theory and concepts as needed; we won't overload you with the theory to start.

4. Learning the 'hard way' is the easiest way: you'll retain more information doing exercise-based learning, where you can make your own mistakes, learn from them, and fix them.

5. Provide structured goals and deadlines. One of the hardest parts about learning is staying motivated and staying accountable to yourself through challenges. In this course you can interact with us and fellow attendees and also find out what 'reasonable' deadlines are to complete exercises to keep your learning a continuous, ongoing process.
